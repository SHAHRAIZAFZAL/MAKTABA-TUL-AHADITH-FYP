# MAKTABA-TUL-AHADITH-FYP
1. Abstract:
In the modern age, access to authentic Islamic knowledge and services is of utmost importance for 
Muslims worldwide. However, finding reliable sources and utilities that cater to their diverse needs can 
be challenging, especially when it comes to credibility and quality. The difficulty in navigating and 
accessing Islamic sources can be a problem for the average person seeking to deepen their 
understanding of Islam. "Maktaba-tul-Ahadith" (translated “Library of Ahadith”) is a 
comprehensive web application designed to address these challenges faced by users seeking access to 
Islamic resources. The project aims to provide a user-friendly platform offering a diverse array of 
features such as Quranic translations with linguistic insights, AI-driven thematic verse retrieval, and an 
extensive Hadith collection from major books. The inclusion of a robust search functionality in Arabic, 
English, and Urdu enhances the exploration of Islamic texts, including a unique AI chatbot for 
personalized inquiries. Additionally, the platform incorporates a rich collection of Islamic books, each 
searchable and navigable, surpassing limitations of static PDFs. The project integrates prayer timings, 
an Islamic calendar, a zakat calculator, biographies, knowledgeable articles, and an Arabic learning 
course, ensuring a holistic experience. The focus on compatibility and user experience guarantees 
seamless cross-platform accessibility, facilitating widespread utilization. By amalgamating technology 
with Islamic scholarship, "Maktaba-tul-Ahadith" endeavors to be a pivotal resource, fostering a deeper 
understanding of Islamic teachings and practices.

2. Product: 
“Maktaba-tul-Ahadith” is a web application aimed at providing a user-friendly platform for accessing 
Islamic books, Hadith, and Quranic resources in multiple languages and advanced features. The 
software addresses the challenge of limited accessibility to authentic Islamic texts, offering a solution 
that integrates traditional scholarship with modern technology.

3. Background:
The domain of this project involves the intersection of technology and Islamic scholarship, recognizing 
the need for a comprehensive platform that caters to the diverse linguistic and informational 
requirements of users seeking deeper insights into Islamic literature. 
Although there are several Islamic-themed applications and websites available worldwide, none of 
them can be considered comprehensive, addressing all aspects of Islam to satisfy users' needs. Some 
are dedicated solely to the Quran, others to Hadith studies, and some offer just a single specific feature. 
Despite the advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) in various fields, it has not yet been fully 
implemented in Islamic studies. We drew inspiration from major related works, and our points of 
differentiation are as follows: 
- Maktaba Shamila: This is the largest database of Islamic texts on the Internet, but it is only 
available in Arabic, difficult to navigate, and lacks specific features. We aim to expand this 
database by offering it in multiple languages and implementing features to enhance navigation and 
text search capabilities.
- Kitab-o-Sunnat Library: It offers Islamic books in Urdu as downloadable PDFs. We plan to 
make these books available in a Unicode system for easier searching and browsing, which is a 
substantial undertaking. 
- Quran(.com): This website includes the Quran with translations and brief tafseers (exegesis). We 
intend to implement advanced AI algorithms to allow users to search for specific topics and gain 
in-depth knowledge quickly, as opposed to manual searching. We will also provide additional 
tafseers along with their authenticity status. 
- Islam 360: This mobile application lacks availability for desktop users and has limitations in 
searchability, Islamic utilities, tools, knowledgeable articles, and biographies to aid users in 
understanding Islam. It also lacks differentiation between authentic and unauthentic content. We 
will address these limitations by introducing a methodology to display the grading of Ahadith and 
tafseers by various scholars (indicating 'Sahih' or 'Daeef') and 'Takhreej' to cross-reference with 
other books. These features will be especially valuable for researchers and students.

In summary, our project stands out from previous works by prioritizing User Experience and offering a 
comprehensive set of utilities within a single application. The integration of an AI chatbot into Islamic 
texts is, to the best of our knowledge, a unique feature in our application. We also place a strong 
emphasis on ensuring the authenticity and validity of these texts to prevent potential confusion and 
misinformation among users.

7. Miscellaneous:
Development Environment: 
This project is developed using a straightforward stack of technologies that emphasizes simplicity and

The primary tools and technologies include: 
• Source Code Editor: The codebase is created and maintained using Visual Studio Code (VS 
Code), a source code editor. 
• Web Server: To serve the web application, Apache is utilized as the web server. It handles HTTP 
requests and serves HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP files to the client's browser. 
• Frontend Technologies: For the frontend design and development, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript 
are used. 
• Backend Technology: PHP is used on the server side to handle dynamic content generation, 
server-side scripting, and database interactions. 
• Database: As the relational database management system (RDBMS), MySQL is employed to store 
and manage structured data. It facilitates efficient data retrieval and storage for various aspects of 
the application.
